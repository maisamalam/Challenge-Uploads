For this assignment I utilized VBA scripting to analyze stock market data.

In this assignment, I developed a script that iterates through a year's worth of stock data and generates the following information:

Ticker symbol: Identifies the stock being analyzed.
Yearly change: Calculates the difference between the opening price at the beginning of the year and the closing price at the end of the year.
Percentage change: Determines the percentage change from the opening price to the closing price over the year.
Additionally, I added extra functionality to the script to identify the stock with the "Greatest % increase," "Greatest % decrease," and "Greatest total volume."

To ensure efficiency, I tested the script on the "alphabetical_testing.xlsx" sheet, which contains a smaller dataset, enabling faster execution. The code was designed to perform consistently across all sheets.

VBA scripting has significantly streamlined repetitive tasks, allowing me to accomplish them effortlessly with the click of a button.
