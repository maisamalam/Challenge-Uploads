During this week's challenge, I successfully organized and analyzed a database of 1,000 sample crowdfunding projects using Excel. 

Here are the key tasks I completed:

Conditional Formatting: I applied conditional formatting to the "Outcome" column, assigning different colors based on the success, failure, cancellation, or live status of each campaign.

Percent Funded: I introduced a new "Percent Funded" column that calculated the percentage of funds raised relative to the initial funding goal. I then used conditional formatting with a three-color scale to highlight the values, ranging from dark red at 0% to green at 100% and blue at 200%.

Average Donation: I created an "Average Donation" column using a formula to determine the average amount contributed by each project backer.

Parent Category and Sub-Category: I split the "Category" and "Sub-Category" columns into two separate columns using formulas, creating "Parent Category" and "Sub-Category" columns.

Pivot Table and Pivot Chart: I generated a new sheet with a pivot table that analyzed the initial data to count the number of successful, failed, canceled, and live campaigns per category. I then created a stacked-column pivot chart that could be filtered by country based on this table.

Date Conversion: I added two new columns, "Date Created Conversion" and "Date Ended Conversion," using formulas to convert the Unix timestamps in the "launched_at" and "deadline" columns into Excel's date format.

Pivot Table and Pivot Chart by Date and Outcome: I created another sheet with a pivot table that had columns of outcome, rows of Date Created Conversion, values based on the count of outcomes, and filters based on parent category and years. I then visualized this data using a pivot-chart line graph.

Additionally, I created a report in Microsoft Word to answer questions about the crowdfunding campaign data, drew conclusions, identified limitations of the dataset, and proposed additional tables and graphs for further analysis.

In summary, I successfully completed the challenge, leveraging Excel's functionalities to uncover market trends and insights in the crowdfunding domain.
